# Installing Postgres

Before we can insert and query data with postgres, we will need to learn how to install postgres and create our first database. 

There are multiple ways to install postgres. 

# Mac 
Normally we would use the `brew` package manager but the [excellent postgresapp](https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html) is actually the recommended & easiest way to install postgresql on a Mac. This is strongly recommended.

# Windows -wsl and Ubuntu Linux
