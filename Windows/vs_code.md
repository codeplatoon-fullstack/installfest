# VSCode with `code`
- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- During install, VSCode will add itself to your system's PATH environmental 
variable. This will allow you to open VSCode from the terminal by simply typing 
`code`. You can also open files in VSCode from the terminal by typing `code SOME_FILENAME`.
