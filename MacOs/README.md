# MacOs Installfest


## What we'll cover
We are going to install everything that you will need for this course. Please do this in order!

1. Visual Studio Code & `code`
2. XCode
3. Homebrew
4. Node.js 
5. Python
6. PostgreSQL

## Prerequesites

- Make sure you have an Apple ID
- Download XCode from Mac App Store
- Ensure that you're running the most recent operating system. You can check your version by going to "System Preferences" and clicking on "Software Update"


## VSCode with `code`

- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). If you're on an M1 Mac, click on `Apple Silicon`.
- Once VSCode is successfully installed, please ensure that VSCode could be found inside your Applications folder. If it isn't in your `Applications`, it will be located under `Downloads`. Grab the VSCode application and drag it into your `Applications` folder.
- Open VSCode and open the `Command Palette` by pressing (Cmd + Shift + P)
- Type `shell command` into the Command Palette and click on the following option: `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`
- Close VSCode
- Now you can open files from your terminal in VSCode.


## XCode

Run the following command in the terminal.

```sh
    xcode-select --install
```

This installs the Command Line Tools package via the Terminal application. This is to ensure you have it installed correctly and in the correct path.


## Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS. We can install it by running the following:

```sh
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Let's check if we've installed homebrew correctly.

```sh
    #run the following to check where brew is located
    which brew
    #We should see the path below
    #/usr/local/bin/brew
```

Homebrew is going to do a lot of work for us in that it manages our software versions, so always ensure that it's up-to-date and that it's healthy.

```sh
    brew update
```

and

```sh
    brew doctor
```

`brew doctor` may tell you a lot of stuffâ€¦ you'll want to read through each item, and attempt to resolve the issue for Homebrew. Warnings are good to read but are not mandatory to fix. We're ideally shooting for a message like this:

```sh
    brew doctor
    #Should return:
    #Your system is ready to brew.
```


## Installing Node.js, Python, and PostgreSQL

### Node.js & npm

Node does not come built in to Mac, so we need to install it. First, we'll install `npm`, the 'Node package manager'. In VS code, inside of your `bash` terminal. We will install `Node.js` and `npm` by running the following command:

```bash
   brew install npm
```

Since you might need different versions of Node for different projects, we won't be installing node directly with `npm`. Instead, we'll first install `n` (very descriptive name), which we can use to install a specific version of Node. We'll install `n` globally by using the `-g` flag, because `n` is used at the command-line for different node projects, not for individual projects. You might need administrator privileges to install node modules globally, so we put `sudo` ( (S)uper (U)ser (DO) ) at the start of the command to run it as an administrator. When you run commands with `sudo`, you'll be asked to type your user account password at the commandline. You won't see your password (or even `****`) as you type it, so make sure you type it carefully. 

```sh
    sudo npm install -g n 
```


Download the latest stable (production-ready, non-experimental) version of node.

```sh
    sudo n stable
```

After both `Node.js` and `npm` are installed we could create a folder with a file and test that
we could run JavaScript using node.
```bash
    #create a folder
    mkdir nodetest

    #create a file
    touch nodetest/hello.js

    #open file and log "Hello World!"
    code nodetest/hello.js

    #on hello.js
    console.log("Hello World!");

    #on bash terminal
    node hello.js

    #we should see the following on the terminal
    Hello World!
```

### Python

In VS code, inside of your `bash` terminal. We will install `python`
by running the following command

```bash
    brew install python
```

Now we want to create a folder with a python file 

```bash
    #creates folder
    mkdir pythonTest

    #creates file
    touch hello.py 
```

Finally, we will enter a print statement on our `hello.py` file and run python on
the command line:
```bash
    #In hello.py
    print("Hello World!")

    #in bash terminal
    python3 hello.py

    #we should see the following on the terminal
    Hello World!
```

Now that we have python working, we want to test it's ability to create a virtual
environment by running the following on the `bash` terminal:

```bash
    #now to create our virtual environment we will run the following
    python3 -m venv <name>
```

We should see a folder with the `name` you provided for your venv. Inside that
folder we should see a bin folder holding an `activate` script, a `pip` script,
and several others. (ensure both the activate and pip scripts are present if not
contanct an instructor)

### PostgreSQL

In VS code, inside of your `bash` terminal. We will install PostgreSQL
by running the following command:

```bash
    brew install postgresql
```

Now we can make sure PostgreSQL is started:

```bash
    brew services restart postgresql@14
```

To enter PostgreSQL we will have to enter the postgres account.
```bash
    #PostgreSQL
    psql postgres
```
