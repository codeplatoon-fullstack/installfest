# Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS. We can install it by running the following:

```sh
    /bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Let's check if we've installed homebrew correctly.

```sh
    #run the following to check where brew is located
    which brew
    #We should see the path below
    #/usr/local/bin/brew
```

Homebrew is going to do a lot of work for us in that it manages our software versions, so always ensure that it's up-to-date and that it's healthy.

```sh
    brew update
```

and

```sh
    brew doctor
```

`brew doctor` may tell you a lot of stuffâ€¦ you'll want to read through each item, and attempt to resolve the issue for Homebrew. Warnings are good to read but are not mandatory to fix. We're ideally shooting for a message like this:

```sh
    brew doctor
    #Should return:
    #Your system is ready to brew.
```
