# Installing node.js on Ubuntu Linux

In this section, we'll use `apt` to install `npm`, the default package manager for node. We'll then use `npm` to install `n`, which is a tool to help manage different versions of `node`. Lastly, we'll use `n` to install the latest stable version of `node`.

```bash
# use apt to install npm
$ sudo apt install npm
# use npm to install n (-g means globally, as opposed to in a specific project/folder)
$ sudo npm install -g n
# use n to install the latest stable version of node
$ sudo n stable
```

Close and reopen your terminal if necessary and test that both the commands `node` and `npm` are recognized.
